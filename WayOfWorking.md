# Way of Working

We find ourselves between the Foundation Established state and the In Use state.
We have agreed on the practices and tools that we believe must be determined before 
the project begins, meaning that the rest can be worked out as we move along. We have
also communicated our strengths and weaknesses and found a usable way of working.
While we do use these practices, we have not explicitly evaluated them in a systematic manner.
Hence, we have technically not entered the In Use state yet.
